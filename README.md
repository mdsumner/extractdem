# extractdem

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of extractdem is to extract values from the [REMA Reference
Elevation Model of Antarctica](https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/rema/), and
maybe other DEMs if this works.

## Installation

You don’t want to do this.

## What then

To use this do the following:

- [fork this repository](https://github.com/mdsumner/extractdem/fork)
- enable Actions in the fork, click on \*Actions” and confirm ok, but
  also click on “get-data” and confirm that too
- delete the output Parquet “longlat_points_dem.parquet”, write your own
  “longlat_points.parquet”, commit the new parquet (it’s important that
  you have deleted the output Parquet and commit that change)
- push your changes to your fork, the action will generate the output
  Parquet ‘longlat_points_dem.parquet’ in your fork

WIP!!!

## Maybe we should just have you run it locally …
